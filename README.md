Viridian from the game [VVVVVV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/) on the Game Boy!

This is also my first contact with `Makefile`s and I must say they are quite handy.

To play:

1. `make build` - This produces `viridian.gb` which you can run using your emulator of choice. Building requires [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/).
2. Alternatively, you can run it using one of these selected emulators:
    * `make run_bgb` - This runs [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/#downloads) (../bgb/bgb64.exe) using WINE.
    * `make run_emulicious` - This runs [Emulicious](https://emulicious.net/downloads/) (../Emulicious.jar) using Java.
